    <p>
        Numerical analysis and experimental validation of the thermal behaviour of a lithium self-field MPD thruster. 
        Two phases of the thruster were studied: the heat-up phase, where only the heater is activated, as well as the 
        firing phase, where plasma is initiated. Future works are laid out to further understand this thermal behaviour 
        with higher accuracy and precision.

    <p>
        Theoretical design of a space mission to establish communication, data relay and object tracking architectures in the cislunar 
        domain within a $400 million budget to support NASA&apos;s Artemis program. Led a 24-person team over 12 weeks to develop a 
        4-satellite mission satisfying the Request For Proposal. Presented the mission design to space systems experts at NASA Goddard 
        Space Flight Center.

    <p>
        Designed, manufactured and programmed an autonomous 10 kg SaRR under $750 to manoeuvre through a winding chute, climb over a 
        12” wall, navigate towards a light source and deposit a medkit by a “trapped victim”.

    <span class="sidenote">University of Oxford, Oct 2022 to Jun 2023. Supervised by Professor Kam Chana and Professor John Coull. 
        First-Class Honours.</span>
    <p>
        Developed a novel method of high frequency and high sensitivity gas analysis by pulsing, through a soldered 9-pin d-sub 
        connection, the tungsten filament of a MEMS gas flow sensor as a thin-film and obtaining heat curves. Derived and validated 
        a finite-elements model using high pressure argon gas, compressed dry air and exhaled breath. Improved the measurement frequency 
        by 3 orders of magnitude compared to gas sensors on the current market

    <p>
        A free flight simulator was coded on MATLAB through a finite-elements approach. A progression of models were tested to 
        sequentially introduce complexities such as vortex shedding. The final model was validated against existing data, 
        then used to generate flight trajectory data which was matched to a reference data for optimisation of aerodynamic parameters.
