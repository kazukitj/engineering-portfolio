    <span class="sidenote">Princeton University, Aug 2023 to Apr 2024. Advised by Professor Edgar Y. Choueiri. 
        Inducted into Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Honour Society.</span>
    <p>
        Numerical analysis and experimental validation of the thermal behaviour of a lithium self-field MPD thruster. 
        Two phases of the thruster were studied: the heat-up phase, where only the heater is activated, as well as the 
        firing phase, where plasma is initiated. Future works are laid out to further understand this thermal behaviour 
        with higher accuracy and precision.

    <p><b>Skills</b>: Finite-elements MATLAB model, Optimisation</p>
    <p>
        This project involved building a free flight simulator on MATLAB, through a finite-elements approach. A progression of models were tested to sequentially introduce complexities such as vortex shedding. The final model was validated against existing data, then used to generate flight trajectory data which was matched to a reference data for optimisation of aerodynamic parameters.
