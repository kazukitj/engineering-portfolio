    <p><b>Skills</b>: Finite-elements MATLAB model, Optimisation</p>
    <p>
        This project involved building a free flight simulator on MATLAB, through a finite-elements approach. A progression of models were tested to sequentially introduce complexities such as vortex shedding. The final model was validated against existing data, then used to generate flight trajectory data which was matched to a reference data for optimisation of aerodynamic parameters.
